# GPGPU-CUDA-Parallel-Programming
It's a GPU-based program that helps to speed up the execution time of gene recombination process
## Getting Started

Please download all the files before you test the program. It includes Data, Data1, and all other source codes.

### Prerequisites
Before you run the program, you need:
1. CUDA 7.0.28 
2. OpenMPI 1.10.2
3. CMake

### Installing
Follow all the steps from those websites:
1. https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-70 for CUDA 7.0.28
2. https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.10/ for OpenMPI 1.10.2
3. https://cmake.org/download/ for downloading the CMake

## Running the tests

1. Compile the program
```
Use 'make' to compile the program.
Use 'make clean' to clean all the object file.
```

2. Run the program
```
Type ./mpi_implementation
```

3. Be patient
```
The program needs at least 2.5 days to complete all the process
```
