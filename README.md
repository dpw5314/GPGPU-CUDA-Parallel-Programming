# GPGPU-CUDA-Parallel-Programming
It's a GPU-based program that helps to speed up the execution time of gene recombination process
## Getting Started

Please download all the files before you test the program. It includes .....

### Prerequisites
Before you run the program, you need:
1. CUDA 7.0.28 
2. OpenMPI 1.10.2
3. CMake

### Installing
Follow all the steps from those websites:
1. https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-70 for CUDA 7.0.28
2. https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.10/ for OpenMPI 1.10.2
3. https://cmake.org/download/ for downloading the CMake

## Running the tests

1. Compile the program


```
If you use the terminal, move to the directory MPI and type 'make'.
Use 'make clean' if you want to compile again, it will clean all the object files and also the main code.
```
